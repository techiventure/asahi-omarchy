# Conditionally disable tmpfs /tmp to prevent "no space left on device" errors during AUR builds
#
# By default, Arch Linux mounts /tmp as tmpfs (RAM-based), limited to 50% of RAM.
# This causes build failures for large AUR packages (obs-studio-git, chromium, firefox, etc.)
# that extract/build large files in /tmp.
#
# Strategy:
# - Systems with ≥16GB RAM: Keep tmpfs enabled (fast builds, unlikely to run out of space)
# - Systems with <16GB RAM: Disable tmpfs proactively (prevent build failures)
# - Error menu fallback: If build fails due to tmpfs, retry with disk-based /tmp
#
# Masking tmp.mount makes /tmp use actual disk space instead of RAM:
# - Performance impact: ~2-3 seconds slower on modern SSDs (negligible)
# - Reliability gain: Prevents installation failures on large packages
# - Cleanup: /tmp contents are still cleaned after 10 days via systemd-tmpfiles
